# Credit_worthiness_analysis
## Data preprocessing project from Practicum by Yandex

### Goal
Prepare a report for a bank’s loan division to find out if a customer’s marital status, number of children, income and education level, loan purpose, gender and age have an impact on whether they will default on a loan.

### This project's repo includes the following files:

- The project's final jupyter notebook (Data preprocessing project.ipynb);
- A pdf format of the notebook (Data preprocessing project.pdf)
- Input data (credit_scoring_input_data.csv)
- Project description from Practicum (project description_credit_worthiness.pdf)

### This project includes the following steps:

1. Descriptive statistics;
2. Artifacts removal;
3. Missing values replacement;
4. Duplicates removal;
5. Data categorization;
6. Analysis of connections between various features and the target variable.

### Based on the analysis we have come to the following conclusions:

1. The more children a client has, the higher the default rate;
2. Married people have lower default rate;
3. People with average income default more often that those with income below or above average. Overall, retirees tend to default less often than others. The least risky are loans to civil servants with low or high income;
4. The higher the education level, the higher the default rate;
5. People do least often fail on a loan for the purpose of 'real estate' which is probably the most expensive among the 4 purposes, but the second most expensive must be education and people fail on it almost as often as on buying a car (which is on average the least expansive of all). It would be useful to see the amount of a loan in this case to make better conclusions;
6. Younger people tend to default more often on a loan while senior people (in terms of work experience) have the lowest default rates;
7. Women are more likely to payoff a loan. It could probably be explained by the finding that has been replicated in a variety of studies over the years that men are more inclined to take risks than women.

Total time spent on the project: 24.2 hours with a daily average	of 2.69 hours working for 9 days.
